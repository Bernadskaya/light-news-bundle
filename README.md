LightNewsBundle
================

Â¿Another news/blog bundle? Yes!

The intention of LightNewsBundle is to provide a lightweight bundle without dependencies to other heavy bundles like Sonata. 

LightNewsBundle works with Symfony 2.1 and works as a unit of work by itself.

You can use it in your blog or in the news section of your web application.
